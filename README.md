# Projects:
This repository contents some of my in-class and personal projects using programming/scripting languages and 
frameworks such as html, CSS, JS, Java, python, React, angular, Flutter, and more

# Fun fact:
I enjoyed the learning opportunities, the celebration after many failures attempts,
the joy of seeing them work and the gut to jump on new projects ðŸ˜†
